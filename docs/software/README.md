### Project overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for controlling a robot through a user-friendly web interface. It leverages the Robot Operating System (ROS) for robust communication and utilizes a web-based UI for intuitive interaction.

**Key components:**

*   **ROS package (ROS folder):**
    
    *   This folder contains the ROS package that acts as the brains of the user interface control system.
        
    *   It utilizes ROS nodes for communication, message definitions for data exchange, and services for specific functionalities.
        
    *   These components work together to send commands to the robot and receive sensor data for feedback.
        
*   **Web-based UI (UI folder):**
    
    *   This folder holds the source code for the web interface you'll interact with to control the robot.
        
    *   It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to define the layout, styling, and interactive behavior of the user interface.
        
*   **Firmware (firmware folder) (in development):**
    
    *   This folder contains the firmware code specifically designed for the different boards (like teensy or arduino) that controls the robot's hardware.
        
    *   It's the embedded software that translates commands received from the ROS package into actions for the robot's motors, sensors, and other components.
