## Project Overview

This folder contains detailed resources on the chassis, mechanics, assembly, and components of our project. The project currently utilizes electronics from the Linorobot project, which are sufficient for our needs. However, we have upgraded the controller and motor to more powerful, industrial-grade options.

### Folder Structure
- **BOM**: A comprehensive Bill of Materials, listing all components used in the project.
- **CAD_files**: 3D models and design files for the chassis and other mechanical parts.
- **datasheets**: Technical datasheets for the components, providing specifications and detailed information.
- **schematics**: Electrical schematics outlining the circuitry and connections (refer to Linorobot HW).

For guidance on assembling the wheel, please refer to the video demonstrating the correct sequence:
